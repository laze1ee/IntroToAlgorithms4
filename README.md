# The implementing of Introduction To Algorithms fourth edition by Scheme

I read some "little schemer" books, Scheme, a functional programing language, concise and consistent, not wildly using, but only in teaching?:( I wondering that whether it is suitable for implementing algorithms, and this is where this project came about.

I used DrRacket as editor and runtime environment, it is convenient. In fact, there are few differences between Scheme and Racket, I try to avoid using these differences while coding, for example, define a new data type using `define-record-type` in Scheme, but `struct` in Racket. I only used some primitive data type and `list` or `vector` to implement all data structures in that book. You will find that it is easy to use.

In root folder, I wrote some libaray files, you can ignore them.

I would greatly appreciate if could report any issue with the implementation to me.
